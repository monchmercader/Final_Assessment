As many as three dozen congressional Republicans were expected to launch a final challenge to the results of the 2020 presidential election.It has become routine after recent elections for House lawmakers on the losing side to put up a symbolic fight over the results, which they can do under an 1880s law governing the process.

Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) will lead the challenge of the votes and call for an “emergency audit” to investigate baseless fraud allegations.The Post’s Libby Casey will anchor live coverage, featuring reporters Aaron Blake, Rhonda Colvin, James Hohmann and Amber Phillips.

As of January 2021, that exclusivity comes to an end, with Block becoming a free agent. And that means his options behind the wheel are now wide open. “Working  with Ford over the past decade has been awesome.” says Ken Block. “From racing all over the world, to accumulating  a half billion views from Gymkhana THREE to Gymkhana TEN, to creating the Emmy nominated series The Gymkhana Files for Amazon Prime - along with building a fleet of Fords including the iconic AWD Mustang Hoonicorn and F-150 Hoonitruck - it’s been a great partnership. It’s simply been a dream come true to work with the company that built the truck that my Dad drove when I was a teenager. I’m super appreciative to Ford for the support over the years, but I am also looking forward to what an unrestricted 2021 holds, and the ability to spread my wings a bit and play with a lot other toys.2020 was a big year for Block and his Ford vehicles. He took the overall win at Rally Barbados in a WRC2 Ford Fiesta, won his class (and 3rd overall) at Rally Legend in San Marino in his Ford Escort Cossie V2, and also won the first ever Projekt E race of the FIA World RallyCross Championship in Holjes, Sweden, in a Ford Fiesta. Along with winning races, Block and Hoonigan launched the all-new viral video series,- Hoonicorn Vs The World. Spanning 11 episodes, the series features Ken racing his 1965 Ford Mustang RTR Hoonicorn against a variety of wild vehicles including a McLaren Senna and the World’s Fastest Donk. The series has been viewed over 34 million times since its launch in late November. What does the next chapter have in store? Ken Block and Hoonigan Racing Division will be announcing new partnerships very soon. In the meantime, enjoy this video of Ken’s favorite Ford – the 1,400 horsepower AWD Mustang Hoonicorn V2 – get taken on its “last ride”."

Today I am going to be painting and customizing a pair of my white vans. Shoes are such a fun item to paint, and I have so many ideas for ways to decorate these. I hope I give you some inspiration for a fun painting project!

This is always such a cool, creative and easy activity to do if you're bored or need to get over artist's block.

I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess.

Joe Biden called it one of the “darkest days in US history”.  He  said it was the culmination of four years of attacks by Mr Trump on democracy, justice and the media. Leading Republicans are distancing themselves from Mr Trump, who has not condemned the rioters.   There are growing calls for him to be stripped of the Presidency —  just days before the official handover to Joe Biden.

Charles Grassley, the president pro-tempore, were taken to a secure location.A spokesperson for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she was “safe,” but would not elaborate on her whereabouts.Members of Congress were ordered to take shelter in the complex.At the same time, shocking images of a protester dangling from the balcony of the Senate chamber, a woman drenched in blood on a stretcher, Capitol police pointing guns on the floor of the House of Representatives, and other chaotic scenes played on television screens and Twitter feeds around the nation.“This is a coup attempt,” tweeted Rep. Adam Kinzinger, an Illinois Republican.Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah blamed Trump for the riot.“This is what the president has caused today, this insurrection,” said Romney, the GOP’s 2012 presidential nominee. » Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision» Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC» Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassicTurn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.

Trump supporters, including members of the extremist group The Proud Boys, also traveled to the nation's capital to protest Biden's win, echoing the president's false and unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud.After Trump addressed protesters on the national mall, they marched to the Capitol and charged the halls of the building, forcing evacuations of lawmakers, Congressional staff and journalists covering the proceedings. Police arrested 13 people and one woman was shot and killed in the violence.Once the area was cleared by law enforcement officials, proceedings resumed. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called on her chamber to finish the process they began. “Today, a shameful assault was made on our democracy ... It was anointed at the highest level of government. It cannot, however, deter us from our responsibility to validate the election, she said in a statement.Stream your PBS favorites with the PBS app: https://to.pbs.org/2Jb8twGFind more from PBS NewsHour at https://www.pbs.org/newshourSubscribe to our YouTube channel: https://bit.ly/2HfsCD6Follow us:Facebook: http://www.pbs.org/newshourTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/newshourInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/newshourSubscribe:PBS NewsHour podcasts: https://www.pbs.org/newshour/podcastsNewsletters: https://www.pbs.org/newshour/subscribe"

Viewer discretion is advised. Pro-Trump protesters stormed the Capitol building in Washington,  DC after a march decrying the vote in the Electoral College and oppose Congress' certification of the Republican president's Nov. 3 election loss. Protesters violently stormed the House Chamber to prevent President-Elect Joe Biden’s certification, leaving at least one woman dead and an unknown number injured at this time. The Metropolitan Police Department of Washington, D.C., said the woman, who was shot inside the Capitol during the protest, died at a nearby hospital. No other details were provided.The protests interrupted Congress as Republican lawmakers mounted their first official challenge to the certification of Biden’s presidential election win, objecting to state results from Arizona as they took up Trump’s relentless effort to overturn the election results in an extraordinary joint session of Congress.Democrats and Republicans condemned the mob as chaos descended onto the House Chamber floor and protesters supporting the president breached the Capitol building’s doors.For more info, please go to https://globalnews.ca/news/7558598/us-election-congress-biden-win-trump/Subscribe to Global News Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/20fcXDcLike Global News on Facebook HERE: http://bit.ly/255GMJQFollow Global News on Twitter HERE: http://bit.ly/1Toz8mtFollow Global News on Instagram HERE: https://bit.ly/2QZaZIB#uspoli #SaveAmerica #StopTheSteal #Trump #GlobalNews"

That sequel comes three years later in the form of Wonder Woman 1984, which in a historic first for a massive superhero blockbuster - came out on streaming at the same time as in theatres!Wonder Woman 1984 movie definitely raises some questions. Like why did Steve Trevor return through some random guy? Why are they using this man’s body for anything they like? Why is there a fully-fueled jet lying around at the Smithsonian and how does Steve Trevor know how to fly it? How does Diana know how to make it invisible? How did Wonder Woman get her lasso around Max Lord? How did literally everyone renounce their wishes? How did nobody wish the world to immediately end? What exactly is the message of this movie?!To answer all these questions and more, step inside the Pitch Meeting that led to Wonder Woman 1984!

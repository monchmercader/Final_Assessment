As of January 2021, that exclusivity comes to an end, with Block becoming a free agent. And that means his options behind the wheel are now wide open. “Working  with Ford over the past decade has been awesome.” says Ken Block. “From racing all over the world, to accumulating  a half billion views from Gymkhana THREE to Gymkhana TEN, to creating the Emmy nominated series The Gymkhana Files for Amazon Prime - along with building a fleet of Fords including the iconic AWD Mustang Hoonicorn and F-150 Hoonitruck - it’s been a great partnership. It’s simply been a dream come true to work with the company that built the truck that my Dad drove when I was a teenager. I’m super appreciative to Ford for the support over the years, but I am also looking forward to what an unrestricted 2021 holds, and the ability to spread my wings a bit and play with a lot other toys.2020 was a big year for Block and his Ford vehicles. He took the overall win at Rally Barbados in a WRC2 Ford Fiesta, won his class (and 3rd overall) at Rally Legend in San Marino in his Ford Escort Cossie V2, and also won the first ever Projekt E race of the FIA World RallyCross Championship in Holjes, Sweden, in a Ford Fiesta. Along with winning races, Block and Hoonigan launched the all-new viral video series,- Hoonicorn Vs The World. Spanning 11 episodes, the series features Ken racing his 1965 Ford Mustang RTR Hoonicorn against a variety of wild vehicles including a McLaren Senna and the World’s Fastest Donk. The series has been viewed over 34 million times since its launch in late November. What does the next chapter have in store? Ken Block and Hoonigan Racing Division will be announcing new partnerships very soon. In the meantime, enjoy this video of Ken’s favorite Ford – the 1,400 horsepower AWD Mustang Hoonicorn V2 – get taken on its “last ride”."

Today I am going to be painting and customizing a pair of my white vans. Shoes are such a fun item to paint, and I have so many ideas for ways to decorate these. I hope I give you some inspiration for a fun painting project! I love making custom shoes because you can really put your own style on them and make them personal to you (even if you never actually wear them lol). This is always such a cool, creative and easy activity to do if you're bored or need to get over artist's block.

For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/2NGeIviProtesters supporting President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, causing Congress to suspend proceedings to confirm the election of Joe Biden as president.Protesters freely roamed through the Capitol complex, including the Senate chamber, where one man stood on the president of the Senate’s chair and shouted, “Trump won that election!”Several law enforcement officials said at least one person in the Capitol building had been shot, and that at least one improvised explosive device was been found on the Capitol grounds.Vice President Mike Pence, who had been presiding over the count of Electoral College votes, was rushed out of the Senate as the Capitol complex went into lockdown when Trump supporters began pouring into the building.Pence and Sen. Charles Grassley, the president pro-tempore, were taken to a secure location.A spokesperson for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she was “safe,” but would not elaborate on her whereabouts.Members of Congress were ordered to take shelter in the complex.At the same time, shocking images of a protester dangling from the balcony of the Senate chamber, a woman drenched in blood on a stretcher, Capitol police pointing guns on the floor of the House of Representatives, and other chaotic scenes played on television screens and Twitter feeds around the nation.“This is a coup attempt,” tweeted Rep. Adam Kinzinger, an Illinois Republican.Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah blamed Trump for the riot.“This is what the president has caused today, this insurrection,” said Romney, the GOP’s 2012 presidential nominee. » Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision» Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC» Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassicTurn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.

Peterson to talk about Matthew’s new book, his upbringing, his relationships with his mother and father, his journey to being at peace with his fame, what it’s like to play malevolent or dark characters in movies or on television, and a surprising satirical review of Greenlights. Find Matthew McConaughey on Twitter @McConaughey and on Instagram @officiallymcconaughey and basically anywhere. Check out his new book Greenlights, which has sold more than 1 million copies, available at https://www.amazon.com/Greenlights-Matthew-McConaughey/dp/0593139135Dr. Jordan B. Peterson's new book, Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life, is available for preorder now: https://amzn.to/3l16Hzk-Show Notes:[1:00] Jordan Peterson kicks off the conversation by asking why and how Matthew McConaughey wrote his book Greenlights.[4:00] Matthew realized he needed to write the book himself without a ghostwriter as initially planned and dig back into his journals as a form of necessary reflection on the past.[6:00] Matthew’s old journals revealed their common thread through all the stories, poems, and bumper stickers. That common thread was the creation of good things in life through mindset or action “Greenlights.”[12:00] Jordan talks about his initial response after reading Matthew’s book and how his expectations were changed.[14:00] Matthew talks about his solo trips when starting to create the structure of his book. Jordan comments that this was a book written by a celebrity that did not really focus on the traditional parts of being a celebrity (very family-focused and foundational). Matthew states, “When we were editing the book, I found that the more personal the stories became, the more relatable they seemed to become, to the human condition, and that was my hope.”[18:00] Jordan and Matthew revisit the African trip, chasing dreams and having the same exact dream multiple times over the span of many years.[24:00] What was the personal impact on Matthew during his trip to Africa where he got to strip away the identity we all know him for and exist as something else? Jordan comments that very often, people confuse their reputation with who they really are, and they start to act as a representation of their reputation instead of themselves; it’s an easy trap to fall into.[22:00] Matthew discusses dealing with the pitfalls of fame. Matthew covers his changing relationship with his mother due to success.[25:00] Jordan B. Peterson asks Matthew McConaughey about some of his acting work in True Detective and playing dark characters. “How do you play a dark role very well without letting the darkness invade you?”[32:00] Matthew talks about the positive aspects of the sometimes tense relationship with his father and having a childhood that balanced love and hardship directed from the same people.[37:00] Jordan and Matthew continue talking about going deeper into the psychology of a dark character like Rustin Cole on True Detective[45:30] Matthew expanded on the short-term effects of initial fame.[51:30] Matthew and Jordan discuss the long-term effects of fame. [55:00] Jordan points out, “If flawed people were incapable of creativity, we would have no creativity.”[1:03:00] How Matthew and Jordan first became friends.[1:07:30] Matthew shares a comical review of his own book written as if Jordan was the one reviewing it.--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---Donations: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donateMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson--- BOOKS ---Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/beyond-order-12-more-rules-for-life/12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/--- LINKS ---Website: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/Blog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/Podcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/Reading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/Twitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpetersonInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson--- PRODUCTS ---Personality Course:  https://jordanbpeterson.com/personalitySelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/Understand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/Merchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson"

More than 6,000 National Guard troops will be in Washington DC, where a state of emergency has been declared until the day after Joe Biden's inauguration later this month. Meanwhile, authorities have announced new arrests and charges, and the FBI has appealed to the public to help bring more rioters to justice. And Twitter has become the latest social media giant to lock Trump out - permanently banning the president from the platform, citing the risk of further incitement of violence.The violent scenes of a few days ago have made way for this: a state of emergency, an unscalable fence, and more than six thousand National Guard troops. Stricter security measures are due to remain in place until after Joe Biden's inauguration this month.DC Residents, meanwhile, are still coming to terms with Wednesday's riot. Dozens of those who stormed the Capitol have now been arrested, with more arrests expected in the coming days. The FBI has appealed to the public to help bring more rioters to justice.House Democrats are pressing ahead with an article of impeachment on Monday, a move which would make Donald Trump the first ever President to be impeached twice. It could also mean that Trump would be unable to run for public office in future. It's a move that has received support from some Republicans, but critics say their turn against Trump has come too late.  As for President Trump, he's now been banned from Twitter as well as other social media platforms, who're quoting concerns over inciting further violence. Tech giants and members of Trump's own party may now also be turning against him, but across the country, there's still no shortage of people who support the outgoing president.Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1For more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/Follow DW on social media:►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnewsFür Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/channel/deutschewelle#DonaldTrump #GOP #UsCapitolRiots"

Images from the riot show Brock inside the U.S. Senate chamber with white flex cuffs.Cameras weren't allowed inside the federal courthouse in Fort Worth. The Monday hearing lasted just five minutes and Brock was escorted into the courtroom by two U.S Marshals.A judge determined Brock qualified for a court-appointed defense attorney. Brock was then ordered held in the custody of the U.S. Marshals until his probable cause and detention hearing scheduled for Thursday.A mug shot, released by the grapevine police department shortly afterward Monday’s appearance, shows how brock looked at the time of the brief hearing. His hands were cuffed in front of his black t-shirt and his legs shackled around his jeans.The retired lieutenant colonel in the Air Force Reserves was identified by his ex-wife as the man photographed -- and captured on surveillance video wearing combat gear and items to potentially detain and arrest people on the senate floor during the January 6 Capitol riot.The arrest affidavit quoted Brock's ex-wife, who reportedly called the FBI National Threat Operations Center. She said, in part, I just know that when I saw this was happening I was afraid he would be there... It is such a good picture of him and I recognize his patch.There's a wealth of potential criminal offenses in addition to the 2 that they charged that would be available.Richard Roper is a former U.S Attorney for the Northern District of Texas not associated with the case and said video evidence will be key in prosecuting.It nails down the identity of the perpetrator, Roper said.According to the affidavit, filed in the District of Columbia, Brock is charged with one count of knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority and one count of violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds. Both are federal charges.There's two charges, essentially a criminal trespass charge being in a place you’re not authorized to be, Roper said. Both of those charges, interestingly, are misdemeanor charges -- meaning punishment range would be less than one year in prison unless someone carries a dangerous weapon.Brock's defense attorney did not have any comment. But he did say after Thursday's hearing, the case will be turned over to the courts in D.C. since that is where the alleged crimes took place.FOX 4 News is a FOX-owned station serving Dallas-Fort Worth and all of North Texas."

Joe Biden called it one of the “darkest days in US history”.  He  said it was the culmination of four years of attacks by Mr Trump on democracy, justice and the media. Leading Republicans are distancing themselves from Mr Trump, who has not condemned the rioters.   There are growing calls for him to be stripped of the Presidency —  just days before the official handover to Joe Biden.

Pro-Trump protesters stormed the Capitol building in Washington,  DC after a march decrying the vote in the Electoral College and oppose Congress' certification of the Republican president's Nov. 3 election loss. Protesters violently stormed the House Chamber to prevent President-Elect Joe Biden’s certification, leaving at least one woman dead and an unknown number injured at this time. The Metropolitan Police Department of Washington, D.C., said the woman, who was shot inside the Capitol during the protest, died at a nearby hospital. No other details were provided.The protests interrupted Congress as Republican lawmakers mounted their first official challenge to the certification of Biden’s presidential election win, objecting to state results from Arizona as they took up Trump’s relentless effort to overturn the election results in an extraordinary joint session of Congress.Democrats and Republicans condemned the mob as chaos descended onto the House Chamber floor and protesters supporting the president breached the Capitol building’s doors.For more info, please go to https://globalnews.ca/news/7558598/us-election-congress-biden-win-trump/Subscribe to Global News Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/20fcXDcLike Global News on Facebook HERE: http://bit.ly/255GMJQFollow Global News on Twitter HERE: http://bit.ly/1Toz8mtFollow Global News on Instagram HERE: https://bit.ly/2QZaZIB#uspoli #SaveAmerica #StopTheSteal #Trump #GlobalNews"

Shepard Smith reports. For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/2NGeIvi President Donald Trump on Thursday acknowledged for the first time that President-elect Joe Biden’s administration will take charge in less than two weeks.Without mentioning Biden by name, Trump said in a nearly three-minute video that “a new administration will be inaugurated on January 20th.”Trump, who had repeatedly vowed never to concede to Biden, backed dozens of failed lawsuits and flooded his Twitter account with baseless claims of voter fraud.His refusal to accept the election results culminated in a deadly riot on Wednesday, when swarms of his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol and derailed congressional proceedings to tally electors’ votes and confirm Biden’s win in the Nov. 3 election.“Now tempers must be cooled, and calm restored. We must get on with the business of America,” Trump said in his first address to the nation following the riot that left five people dead, including a Capitol police officer.“My focus now turns to ensuring a smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power,” the president added.Biden’s victory was projected by all major news outlets in mid-November and confirmed by Electoral College votes in mid-December. The Republican president has falsely insisted he won in a “landslide,” asserting his reelection was stolen through massive electoral fraud.The president, who was blocked from Twitter for 12 hours on Wednesday, briefly spoke about the pandemonium at the U.S. Capitol.“To those who engaged in the acts of violence and destruction, you do not represent our country. And to those who broke the law, you will pay,” Trump said in the video. In a video on Wednesday, as the mob swarmed the building, Trump said “we love you, you’re very special.”The rioters descended on Capitol directly after Trump told them at a rally outside the White House to march on the home of Congress to protest the election results.» Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision» Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC» Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassicTurn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.

Unaware of what awaits them in each wax-sealed envelope, only one competitor can become the victorious owner of His Royal Task-ness’ golden head and be crowned the next Taskmaster Champion."

Today, we’re going on a Thai street food tour of Kalasin starting early - really early - in the morning.Gai Yang Yai Duan (ไก่ย่างยายเดือน) - Opening from 1 am and selling out by dawn, Gai Yang Yai Duan is a legendary Thai grilled chicken street food stall at the market in Kalasin. The chicken is tasty, especially when dipped in fermented fish sauce chili dip with sticky rice. Nothing like a little grilled chicken at 4 am to wake up to. Price - 30 THB ($1.00) per pieceKuay Jab Rong Ngew (ร้านก๋วยจั๊บโรงงิ้ว) - Another early morning stall is Kuay Jab Rong Ngew, serving a dish called Kuay Jab, but the Isaan version which is soft rice noodles in a thick porridge like gravy. It’s quite tasty and soothing, especially good on a cool morning. Price - 20 THB ($0.67) per bowlJay Du Pla Pao (เจ๊ตุ๊ ปลาเผา ส้มตำ) - One of the popular Thai street foods in Isaan is pla pao, or salt crusted roasted fish. The fish is stuffed with pandan leaves, coated in a thick layer of salt, and then grilled over charcoal. You order a fish, some freshly pounded green papaya salad, and you’re ready for the ultimate lunchtime meal in Kalasin. Jay Du Pla Pao is a fantastic market stall street food restaurant where you can be guaranteed fresh and hotly grilled tilapia. Total price - 170 THB ($5.68)Khao Jee Pab Jang (ข้าวจี้ปั๊บจัง) - Finally to finish off this Thai street food tour of Kalasin, we’re going to eat what is possibly the original rice burger - sticky rice burger coated in duck egg yolk and grill over charcoal. It’s simple, hearty, and fragrant. A perfect afternoon snack when you’re in Kalasin, Thailand. Price - 5 THB ($0.17) per pieceKalasin is not a hugely popular province to visit in Thailand, but there is so good food, people are extremely famous, and you can see real dinosaur footprints!🎵MUSIC: https://goo.gl/HwVjdo——————————————————🍌100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: http://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z👕Get t-shirts and caps:https://migrationology.com/store/——————————————————📱FOLLOW:Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology"

Many businesses in downtown Washington boarded up their windows, fearful that the protest could devolve into the unrest seen in May and June when dozens of businesses were vandalized.  District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser called in National Guard troops to help bolster the city’s police force.  The protests coincide with Wednesday’s congressional vote expected to certify the Electoral College results, which Trump continues to dispute. Trump tweeted support for his supporters and he is expected to personally address them in Washington on Wednesday during a rally on the Ellipse, just south of the White House. Election officials from both political parties, governors in key battleground states and Trump’s former attorney general, William Barr, have said there was no widespread fraud in the election. Nearly all the legal challenges from Trump and his allies have been dismissed by judges, including two challenges rejected by the Supreme Court.#USCapitol #Papadopoulos #Flynn Find out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork Twitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives Tumblr: https://aparchives.tumblr.com/​​Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/You can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/3ca100b8e5124299935315b60ca06cc4"

Like why did Steve Trevor return through some random guy? Why are they using this man’s body for anything they like? Why is there a fully-fueled jet lying around at the Smithsonian and how does Steve Trevor know how to fly it? How does Diana know how to make it invisible? How did Wonder Woman get her lasso around Max Lord? How did literally everyone renounce their wishes? How did nobody wish the world to immediately end?

Is it true? And if so: why? I ate a few bagels, and set out to flunk an opioid test.👇👇👇 SOURCES and REFERENCES 👇👇👇Drug tests don’t just work as a buzzkill, they can keep doctors and patients honest regarding some of the more dangerous drugs known to man. The problem is, poppy seeds can throw a giant wrench in that circle of trust! Poppy seeds come from the papaver somniferum flower native to Turkey, and even though they don’t contain opium, consuming the seeds has historically caused the tests to register opiate use!In this video, I explore how these tests work, what they look for, and how something as simple as a bottle of seeds available at any grocery store, can cause a false positive for painkillers, heroin, morphine, and other drugs.Encyclopedia Britannica: Poppy Seedhttps://www.britannica.com/topic/poppy-seedhttps://www.britannica.com/story/can-eating-poppy-seeds-make-you-fail-a-drug-test Poppy seed, tiny dried seed of the opium poppy, used as food, food flavouring, and the source of poppy-seed oil. Poppy seeds have no narcotic properties, because the fluid contained in the bud that becomes opium is present only before the seeds are fully formed. The plant, Papaver somniferum, is an herbaceous annual native to Greece and the Orient. Poppy seed is an ancient spice; the seed capsules have been found in Switzerland in the remains of prehistoric lake dwellings.Can Eating Poppy Seeds Give You a Positive Drug Test?https://www.healthline.com/health/fitness-nutrition/poppy-seeds-drug-test#bottom-lineIt’s possible that even just one bagel or muffin highly loaded with poppy seeds can lead to a positive urine drug test.LabCorp: Testing Methodologyhttps://www.labcorp.com/frequently-asked-questions/drug-testing/toxicology/testing-methodology#:~:text=LabCorp%20performs%20initial%20drug%20screening,drug%20present%20in%20urine%20samples.

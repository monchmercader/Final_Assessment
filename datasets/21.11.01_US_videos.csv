We started ‚Äútravel hacking‚Äù & finally decided we wanted to travel for one year. After 2 years of saving $ and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016. We started this #travelvlog to share our experiences with friends and family, then decided we really liked vlogging and traveling! After achieving our new goal of 100 countries before 2020 and all 7 continents, we have no plans to slow down anytime soon, and we are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)"

As of January 2021, that exclusivity comes to an end, with Block becoming a free agent. And that means his options behind the wheel are now wide open. ‚ÄúWorking  with Ford over the past decade has been awesome.‚Äù says Ken Block. ‚ÄúFrom racing all over the world, to accumulating  a half billion views from Gymkhana THREE to Gymkhana TEN, to creating the Emmy nominated series The Gymkhana Files for Amazon Prime - along with building a fleet of Fords including the iconic AWD Mustang Hoonicorn and F-150 Hoonitruck - it‚Äôs been a great partnership. It‚Äôs simply been a dream come true to work with the company that built the truck that my Dad drove when I was a teenager. I‚Äôm super appreciative to Ford for the support over the years, but I am also looking forward to what an unrestricted 2021 holds, and the ability to spread my wings a bit and play with a lot other toys.2020 was a big year for Block and his Ford vehicles. He took the overall win at Rally Barbados in a WRC2 Ford Fiesta, won his class (and 3rd overall) at Rally Legend in San Marino in his Ford Escort Cossie V2, and also won the first ever Projekt E race of the FIA World RallyCross Championship in Holjes, Sweden, in a Ford Fiesta. Along with winning races, Block and Hoonigan launched the all-new viral video series,- Hoonicorn Vs The World. Spanning 11 episodes, the series features Ken racing his 1965 Ford Mustang RTR Hoonicorn against a variety of wild vehicles including a McLaren Senna and the World‚Äôs Fastest Donk. The series has been viewed over 34 million times since its launch in late November. What does the next chapter have in store? Ken Block and Hoonigan Racing Division will be announcing new partnerships very soon. In the meantime, enjoy this video of Ken‚Äôs favorite Ford ‚Äì the 1,400 horsepower AWD Mustang Hoonicorn V2 ‚Äì get taken on its ‚Äúlast ride‚Äù."

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit ‚Äî stripped-down sets, an intimate setting ‚Äî just a different space.Bobby Carter | January 8, 2021I don't recall any other artist at the Tiny Desk harmonizing their own introduction, but Philadelphia's own Jazmine Sullivan didn't waste a second, greeting us all by flexing those once-in-a-generation chops from the jump. The singer-songwriter, draped in a trench coat while her band sports all black, are nestled in the corner of a dimly lit space resembling a cabaret.We don't see or hear much from Jazmine Sullivan until she has something to get off her chest. She drops a body of work every five years or so, shakes up the world of R&B with each offering, then quietly goes back to minding her own business. Her latest project, Heaux Tales, is a bold and timely conversation piece addressing truths regarding relationships, sex, social norms, self-worth and a myriad of other topics that women graple with. Each song is masterfully connected to another through unique yet familiar testimonies by women from all walks of life.She starts her Tiny Desk (home) concert with three extended and reworked selections from Heaux Tales, squeezes in thee fan favorite from 2015's Reality Show, then invites Tiny Desk alum H.E.R. to the stage to close with Girl Like Me. Ms. Sullivan, her background vocalists and H.E.R. ate this performance up and left not a crumb on the floor.SET LISTBodies (Intro)The Other SideLost OneLet It BurnGirl Like Me (featuring H.E.R.)MUSICIANSJazmine Sullivan: vocalsH.E.R.: vocalsAlisa Joe: vocalsNatalie Curtis: vocalsAyana George: vocalsDave Watson: drumsSimon Martinez: guitarJermaine Blandford: bassEric Wortham: keysCREDITSVideo: Mansa Twin Johnson, Mignotae Kebede, Evan MorsellAudio: Chauncey BurneyCreative Director: Amaya SeguraSet Design: Matthew EnglebertExecutive Producer: Omari WilliamsTINY DESK TEAMProducer: Bobby CarterVideo Producer: Maia SternAudio Mastering: Josh RogosinTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara Frame, Morgan Noelle SmithExecutive Producer: Lauren OnkeySenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann"

Hopefully you enjoy the content and maybe even take up speedrunning yourself, because it is truly a lot of fun!And yeah, today we tried speedrunning bad minecraft. This is a cursed minecraft mod and I think you can see why. I mean we have guns. I think that just shows how cursed it is. Also there are realistic physics like falling tree... and guns... I don't know why I'm so caught up about that. Whatever, enjoy the speedruns and you definitely will because each one of them is a world record... on a game that no one else speedruns... okay I should just stop talking.Also I'm gonna do this cause all the cool kids do:Not Minecraft, But Water Rises or Minecraft, But Lava Rises, or any other but challenge like that.

After all, Smith ran away from defenses for most of the season.Smith was the frontrunner to win the Heisman on Tuesday night after catching 105 passes for 1,641 yards and 20 touchdowns so far this season. He leads the country in all three categories. Smith would be the first wideout to win the award since Michigan's Desmond Howard in 1991.

YouTubers optimise their video's meta data for discovery due to how the algorithm is like. This isn't anything new. Most people who've been watching YouTube for years would understand this. If you're unhappy and get triggered by this, well, this channel isn't for you then. I‚Äôve provided free workout schedules and programs since day 1 and have always optimised my meta data as such so that's not going to change.Having said that, it doesn't mean the workout do not work. You will still see results by following a suitable program schedule, watching your diet, being in a deficit or surplus (based on your goals), doing exercises in good form, etc. These are all equally important factors. You're not going to get abs, grow a booty, grow biceps magically from 1 or 2 videos, in 1, 2, 3 or 4 weeks cause everyone is different. I've explain multiple times throughout videos throughout my channel over years that it takes time and lots of factors, so don't take a video title out of context. Targetting fat loss is not scientifically proven. Everyone is different and it takes time. When doing any home workouts, do take precaution to exercise in a safe environment, and if you need help or you're not seeing results, I suggest seeing a health and fitness professional to give you tailored advice on your exercise form and dietary needs. I am not a medical professional and what I share on my channel are my views and what has worked for myself. Your health and safety is the utmost importance so find out what works for you."

That sequel comes three years later in the form of Wonder Woman 1984, which in a historic first for a massive superhero blockbuster - came out on streaming at the same time as in theatres!Wonder Woman 1984 movie definitely raises some questions. Like why did Steve Trevor return through some random guy? Why are they using this man‚Äôs body for anything they like? Why is there a fully-fueled jet lying around at the Smithsonian and how does Steve Trevor know how to fly it? How does Diana know how to make it invisible?

I ate a few bagels, and set out to flunk an opioid test.üëáüëáüëá SOURCES and REFERENCES üëáüëáüëáDrug tests don‚Äôt just work as a buzzkill, they can keep doctors and patients honest regarding some of the more dangerous drugs known to man. The problem is, poppy seeds can throw a giant wrench in that circle of trust! Poppy seeds come from the papaver somniferum flower native to Turkey, and even though they don‚Äôt contain opium, consuming the seeds has historically caused the tests to register opiate use!In this video, I explore how these tests work, what they look for, and how something as simple as a bottle of seeds available at any grocery store, can cause a false positive for painkillers, heroin, morphine, and other drugs.Encyclopedia Britannica: Poppy Seedhttps://www.britannica.com/topic/poppy-seedhttps://www.britannica.com/story/can-eating-poppy-seeds-make-you-fail-a-drug-test Poppy seed, tiny dried seed of the opium poppy, used as food, food flavouring, and the source of poppy-seed oil. Poppy seeds have no narcotic properties, because the fluid contained in the bud that becomes opium is present only before the seeds are fully formed. The plant, Papaver somniferum, is an herbaceous annual native to Greece and the Orient. Poppy seed is an ancient spice; the seed capsules have been found in Switzerland in the remains of prehistoric lake dwellings.Can Eating Poppy Seeds Give You a Positive Drug Test?https://www.healthline.com/health/fitness-nutrition/poppy-seeds-drug-test#bottom-lineIt‚Äôs possible that even just one bagel or muffin highly loaded with poppy seeds can lead to a positive urine drug test.LabCorp: Testing Methodologyhttps://www.labcorp.com/frequently-asked-questions/drug-testing/toxicology/testing-methodology#:~:text=LabCorp%20performs%20initial%20drug%20screening,drug%20present%20in%20urine%20samples.

YouTubers optimise their video's meta data for discovery due to how the algorithm is like. This isn't anything new. Most people who've been watching YouTube for years would understand this. If you're unhappy and get triggered by this, well, this channel isn't for you then. I‚Äôve provided free workout schedules and programs since day 1 and have always optimised my meta data as such so that's not going to change.Having said that, it doesn't mean the workout do not work. You will still see results by following a suitable program schedule, watching your diet, being in a deficit or surplus (based on your goals), doing exercises in good form, etc. These are all equally important factors. You're not going to get abs, grow a booty, grow biceps magically from 1 or 2 videos, in 1, 2, 3 or 4 weeks cause everyone is different. I've explain multiple times throughout videos throughout my channel over years that it takes time and lots of factors, so don't take a video title out of context. Targetting fat loss is not scientifically proven. Everyone is different and it takes time. When doing any home workouts, do take precaution to exercise in a safe environment, and if you need help or you're not seeing results, I suggest seeing a health and fitness professional to give you tailored advice on your exercise form and dietary needs. I am not a medical professional and what I share on my channel are my views and what has worked for myself. Your health and safety is the utmost importance so find out what works for you."

As of January 2021, that exclusivity comes to an end, with Block becoming a free agent. And that means his options behind the wheel are now wide open. “Working  with Ford over the past decade has been awesome.” says Ken Block. “From racing all over the world, to accumulating  a half billion views from Gymkhana THREE to Gymkhana TEN, to creating the Emmy nominated series The Gymkhana Files for Amazon Prime - along with building a fleet of Fords including the iconic AWD Mustang Hoonicorn and F-150 Hoonitruck - it’s been a great partnership. It’s simply been a dream come true to work with the company that built the truck that my Dad drove when I was a teenager. I’m super appreciative to Ford for the support over the years, but I am also looking forward to what an unrestricted 2021 holds, and the ability to spread my wings a bit and play with a lot other toys.2020 was a big year for Block and his Ford vehicles. He took the overall win at Rally Barbados in a WRC2 Ford Fiesta, won his class (and 3rd overall) at Rally Legend in San Marino in his Ford Escort Cossie V2, and also won the first ever Projekt E race of the FIA World RallyCross Championship in Holjes, Sweden, in a Ford Fiesta. Along with winning races, Block and Hoonigan launched the all-new viral video series,- Hoonicorn Vs The World. Spanning 11 episodes, the series features Ken racing his 1965 Ford Mustang RTR Hoonicorn against a variety of wild vehicles including a McLaren Senna and the World’s Fastest Donk. The series has been viewed over 34 million times since its launch in late November. What does the next chapter have in store? Ken Block and Hoonigan Racing Division will be announcing new partnerships very soon. In the meantime, enjoy this video of Ken’s favorite Ford – the 1,400 horsepower AWD Mustang Hoonicorn V2 – get taken on its “last ride”."

Today I am going to be painting and customizing a pair of my white vans. Shoes are such a fun item to paint, and I have so many ideas for ways to decorate these. I hope I give you some inspiration for a fun painting project!

This is always such a cool, creative and easy activity to do if you're bored or need to get over artist's block.

This comes as Congress was preparing to confirm the electoral college votes. For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/2NGeIviProtesters supporting President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, causing Congress to suspend proceedings to confirm the election of Joe Biden as president.Protesters freely roamed through the Capitol complex, including the Senate chamber, where one man stood on the president of the Senate’s chair and shouted, “Trump won that election!”Several law enforcement officials said at least one person in the Capitol building had been shot, and that at least one improvised explosive device was been found on the Capitol grounds.Vice President Mike Pence, who had been presiding over the count of Electoral College votes, was rushed out of the Senate as the Capitol complex went into lockdown when Trump supporters began pouring into the building.Pence and Sen. Charles Grassley, the president pro-tempore, were taken to a secure location.A spokesperson for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she was “safe,” but would not elaborate on her whereabouts.Members of Congress were ordered to take shelter in the complex.At the same time, shocking images of a protester dangling from the balcony of the Senate chamber, a woman drenched in blood on a stretcher, Capitol police pointing guns on the floor of the House of Representatives, and other chaotic scenes played on television screens and Twitter feeds around the nation.“This is a coup attempt,” tweeted Rep. Adam Kinzinger, an Illinois Republican.Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah blamed Trump for the riot.“This is what the president has caused today, this insurrection,” said Romney, the GOP’s 2012 presidential nominee. » Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision» Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC» Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassicTurn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.

Peterson to talk about Matthew’s new book, his upbringing, his relationships with his mother and father, his journey to being at peace with his fame, what it’s like to play malevolent or dark characters in movies or on television, and a surprising satirical review of Greenlights. Find Matthew McConaughey on Twitter @McConaughey and on Instagram @officiallymcconaughey and basically anywhere. Check out his new book Greenlights, which has sold more than 1 million copies, available at https://www.amazon.com/Greenlights-Matthew-McConaughey/dp/0593139135Dr. Jordan B. Peterson's new book, Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life, is available for preorder now: https://amzn.to/3l16Hzk-Show Notes:[1:00] Jordan Peterson kicks off the conversation by asking why and how Matthew McConaughey wrote his book Greenlights.[4:00] Matthew realized he needed to write the book himself without a ghostwriter as initially planned and dig back into his journals as a form of necessary reflection on the past.[6:00] Matthew’s old journals revealed their common thread through all the stories, poems, and bumper stickers. That common thread was the creation of good things in life through mindset or action “Greenlights.”[12:00] Jordan talks about his initial response after reading Matthew’s book and how his expectations were changed.[14:00] Matthew talks about his solo trips when starting to create the structure of his book. Jordan comments that this was a book written by a celebrity that did not really focus on the traditional parts of being a celebrity (very family-focused and foundational). Matthew states, “When we were editing the book, I found that the more personal the stories became, the more relatable they seemed to become, to the human condition, and that was my hope.”[18:00] Jordan and Matthew revisit the African trip, chasing dreams and having the same exact dream multiple times over the span of many years.[24:00] What was the personal impact on Matthew during his trip to Africa where he got to strip away the identity we all know him for and exist as something else? Jordan comments that very often, people confuse their reputation with who they really are, and they start to act as a representation of their reputation instead of themselves; it’s an easy trap to fall into.[22:00] Matthew discusses dealing with the pitfalls of fame. Matthew covers his changing relationship with his mother due to success.[25:00] Jordan B. Peterson asks Matthew McConaughey about some of his acting work in True Detective and playing dark characters. “How do you play a dark role very well without letting the darkness invade you?”[32:00] Matthew talks about the positive aspects of the sometimes tense relationship with his father and having a childhood that balanced love and hardship directed from the same people.[37:00] Jordan and Matthew continue talking about going deeper into the psychology of a dark character like Rustin Cole on True Detective[45:30] Matthew expanded on the short-term effects of initial fame.[51:30] Matthew and Jordan discuss the long-term effects of fame. [55:00] Jordan points out, “If flawed people were incapable of creativity, we would have no creativity.”[1:03:00] How Matthew and Jordan first became friends.[1:07:30] Matthew shares a comical review of his own book written as if Jordan was the one reviewing it.--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---Donations: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donateMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson--- BOOKS ---Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/beyond-order-12-more-rules-for-life/12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/--- LINKS ---Website: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/Blog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/Podcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/Reading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/Twitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpetersonInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson--- PRODUCTS ---Personality Course:  https://jordanbpeterson.com/personalitySelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/Understand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/Merchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson"

Joe Biden called it one of the “darkest days in US history”.  He  said it was the culmination of four years of attacks by Mr Trump on democracy, justice and the media. Leading Republicans are distancing themselves from Mr Trump, who has not condemned the rioters.   There are growing calls for him to be stripped of the Presidency —  just days before the official handover to Joe Biden.

Pro-Trump protesters stormed the Capitol building in Washington,  DC after a march decrying the vote in the Electoral College and oppose Congress' certification of the Republican president's Nov. 3 election loss. Protesters violently stormed the House Chamber to prevent President-Elect Joe Biden’s certification, leaving at least one woman dead and an unknown number injured at this time. The Metropolitan Police Department of Washington, D.C., said the woman, who was shot inside the Capitol during the protest, died at a nearby hospital. No other details were provided.The protests interrupted Congress as Republican lawmakers mounted their first official challenge to the certification of Biden’s presidential election win, objecting to state results from Arizona as they took up Trump’s relentless effort to overturn the election results in an extraordinary joint session of Congress.Democrats and Republicans condemned the mob as chaos descended onto the House Chamber floor and protesters supporting the president breached the Capitol building’s doors.For more info, please go to https://globalnews.ca/news/7558598/us-election-congress-biden-win-trump/Subscribe to Global News Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/20fcXDcLike Global News on Facebook HERE: http://bit.ly/255GMJQFollow Global News on Twitter HERE: http://bit.ly/1Toz8mtFollow Global News on Instagram HERE: https://bit.ly/2QZaZIB#uspoli #SaveAmerica #StopTheSteal #Trump #GlobalNews"

That sequel comes three years later in the form of Wonder Woman 1984, which in a historic first for a massive superhero blockbuster - came out on streaming at the same time as in theatres!Wonder Woman 1984 movie definitely raises some questions. Like why did Steve Trevor return through some random guy? Why are they using this man’s body for anything they like? Why is there a fully-fueled jet lying around at the Smithsonian and how does Steve Trevor know how to fly it? How does Diana know how to make it invisible? How did Wonder Woman get her lasso around Max Lord? How did literally everyone renounce their wishes? How did nobody wish the world to immediately end? What exactly is the message of this movie?!To answer all these questions and more, step inside the Pitch Meeting that led to Wonder Woman 1984!

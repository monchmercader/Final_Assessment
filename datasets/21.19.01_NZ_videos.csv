As of January 2021, that exclusivity comes to an end, with Block becoming a free agent. And that means his options behind the wheel are now wide open. “Working  with Ford over the past decade has been awesome.” says Ken Block. “From racing all over the world, to accumulating  a half billion views from Gymkhana THREE to Gymkhana TEN, to creating the Emmy nominated series The Gymkhana Files for Amazon Prime - along with building a fleet of Fords including the iconic AWD Mustang Hoonicorn and F-150 Hoonitruck - it’s been a great partnership. It’s simply been a dream come true to work with the company that built the truck that my Dad drove when I was a teenager. I’m super appreciative to Ford for the support over the years, but I am also looking forward to what an unrestricted 2021 holds, and the ability to spread my wings a bit and play with a lot other toys.2020 was a big year for Block and his Ford vehicles. He took the overall win at Rally Barbados in a WRC2 Ford Fiesta, won his class (and 3rd overall) at Rally Legend in San Marino in his Ford Escort Cossie V2, and also won the first ever Projekt E race of the FIA World RallyCross Championship in Holjes, Sweden, in a Ford Fiesta. Along with winning races, Block and Hoonigan launched the all-new viral video series,- Hoonicorn Vs The World. Spanning 11 episodes, the series features Ken racing his 1965 Ford Mustang RTR Hoonicorn against a variety of wild vehicles including a McLaren Senna and the World’s Fastest Donk. The series has been viewed over 34 million times since its launch in late November. What does the next chapter have in store? Ken Block and Hoonigan Racing Division will be announcing new partnerships very soon. In the meantime, enjoy this video of Ken’s favorite Ford – the 1,400 horsepower AWD Mustang Hoonicorn V2 – get taken on its “last ride”."

We've got Mat in 'his' Audi RS6, going up against Yianni's Lamborghini Urus! When it comes to performance stats, both of these are easily drag race ready. The Audi's packing a 4-litre twin-turbo with the ability to put down 600hp & 800Nm of torque! As you might expect though, it's pretty heavy, weighing in at 2,075kg. As for Yianni's Urus? Well under the bonnet you'll find the exact same 4-litre twin-turbo V8 as in the RS6, however it's been tuned to deliver 650hp & 850Nm! It does weigh a bit more though, coming in at 2,199kg. So how do you think this one will play out? We all know Yianni's the king of reaction times (sorry Mat 😬) but will the extra weight work against him?! There's only one way to find out...

Today I am going to be painting and customizing a pair of my white vans. Shoes are such a fun item to paint, and I have so many ideas for ways to decorate these. I hope I give you some inspiration for a fun painting project! I love making custom shoes because you can really put your own style on them and make them personal to you (even if you never actually wear them lol). This is always such a cool, creative and easy activity to do if you're bored or need to get over artist's block.

I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess.

Charles Grassley, the president pro-tempore, were taken to a secure location.A spokesperson for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she was “safe,” but would not elaborate on her whereabouts.Members of Congress were ordered to take shelter in the complex.At the same time, shocking images of a protester dangling from the balcony of the Senate chamber, a woman drenched in blood on a stretcher, Capitol police pointing guns on the floor of the House of Representatives, and other chaotic scenes played on television screens and Twitter feeds around the nation.“This is a coup attempt,” tweeted Rep. Adam Kinzinger, an Illinois Republican.Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah blamed Trump for the riot.“This is what the president has caused today, this insurrection,” said Romney, the GOP’s 2012 presidential nominee. » Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision» Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC» Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassicTurn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.

Peterson Podcast can be found at https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/Matthew McConaughey (actor, producer, and best-selling author of Greenlights) sits down with Jordan B. Peterson to talk about Matthew’s new book, his upbringing, his relationships with his mother and father, his journey to being at peace with his fame, what it’s like to play malevolent or dark characters in movies or on television, and a surprising satirical review of Greenlights.

Check out his new book Greenlights, which has sold more than 1 million copies, available at https://www.amazon.com/Greenlights-Matthew-McConaughey/dp/0593139135Dr. Jordan B. Peterson's new book, Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life, is available for preorder now: https://amzn.to/3l16Hzk-Show Notes:[1:00] Jordan Peterson kicks off the conversation by asking why and how Matthew McConaughey wrote his book Greenlights.[4:00] Matthew realized he needed to write the book himself without a ghostwriter as initially planned and dig back into his journals as a form of necessary reflection on the past.[6:00] Matthew’s old journals revealed their common thread through all the stories, poems, and bumper stickers. That common thread was the creation of good things in life through mindset or action “Greenlights.”[12:00] Jordan talks about his initial response after reading Matthew’s book and how his expectations were changed.[14:00] Matthew talks about his solo trips when starting to create the structure of his book. Jordan comments that this was a book written by a celebrity that did not really focus on the traditional parts of being a celebrity (very family-focused and foundational). Matthew states, “When we were editing the book, I found that the more personal the stories became, the more relatable they seemed to become, to the human condition, and that was my hope.”[18:00] Jordan and Matthew revisit the African trip, chasing dreams and having the same exact dream multiple times over the span of many years.[24:00] What was the personal impact on Matthew during his trip to Africa where he got to strip away the identity we all know him for and exist as something else? Jordan comments that very often, people confuse their reputation with who they really are, and they start to act as a representation of their reputation instead of themselves; it’s an easy trap to fall into.[22:00] Matthew discusses dealing with the pitfalls of fame. Matthew covers his changing relationship with his mother due to success.[25:00] Jordan B. Peterson asks Matthew McConaughey about some of his acting work in True Detective and playing dark characters. “How do you play a dark role very well without letting the darkness invade you?”[32:00] Matthew talks about the positive aspects of the sometimes tense relationship with his father and having a childhood that balanced love and hardship directed from the same people.[37:00] Jordan and Matthew continue talking about going deeper into the psychology of a dark character like Rustin Cole on True Detective[45:30] Matthew expanded on the short-term effects of initial fame.[51:30] Matthew and Jordan discuss the long-term effects of fame. [55:00] Jordan points out, “If flawed people were incapable of creativity, we would have no creativity.”[1:03:00] How Matthew and Jordan first became friends.[1:07:30] Matthew shares a comical review of his own book written as if Jordan was the one reviewing it.--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---Donations: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donateMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson--- BOOKS ---Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/beyond-order-12-more-rules-for-life/12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/--- LINKS ---Website: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/Blog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/Podcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/Reading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/Twitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpetersonInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson--- PRODUCTS ---Personality Course:  https://jordanbpeterson.com/personalitySelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/Understand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/Merchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson"

You can choose your cut of beef, and at this restaurant you get a hot iron griddle over charcoal to cook the beef yourself. Additionally they serve other Ko Khun Pon Yang Kham Beef (โคขุนโพนยางคํา) dishes - Isaan food - like nam tok and laap, made with this special beef.The owner of the restaurant, you can tell is very passionate about the beef he serves, and he ensures the quality by hand picking it out himself each day from the fresh beef.It was one of my first times to eat real Ko Khun Pon Yang Kham Beef (โคขุนโพนยางคํา) and I was impressed by the taste and flavor of this Thai grass fed beef. It’s not as soft or butter as Kobe beef or types of Wagyu, but it has a bit of texture and is very flavorful. I also thoroughly enjoyed the experience eating at Mong Yod Neua Yang Restaurant (ร้านโม้งยอดเนื้อย่าง) - it’s laid back, relaxing, and you can choose the places of beef you like. The sauces were also delicious.Also, when comparing the beef quality to the price, the value is incredible - might be some of the best quality beef for the price that I’ve had.Total price - 950 THB ($31.49) for everythingThank you for watching, and when you’re in Sakhon Nakhon, Thailand, don’t miss eating a local style Thai steakhouse bbq!🎵MUSIC: https://goo.gl/HwVjdo——————————————————🍌100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: http://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z👕Get t-shirts and caps:https://migrationology.com/store/——————————————————📱FOLLOW:Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology"

As many as three dozen congressional Republicans were expected to launch a final challenge to the results of the 2020 presidential election.It has become routine after recent elections for House lawmakers on the losing side to put up a symbolic fight over the results, which they can do under an 1880s law governing the process. It has been less common for senators to join them, but this time a dozen will. Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) will lead the challenge of the votes and call for an “emergency audit” to investigate baseless fraud allegations.The Post’s Libby Casey will anchor live coverage, featuring reporters Aaron Blake, Rhonda Colvin, James Hohmann and Amber Phillips.

As of January 2021, that exclusivity comes to an end, with Block becoming a free agent. And that means his options behind the wheel are now wide open. “Working  with Ford over the past decade has been awesome.” says Ken Block. “From racing all over the world, to accumulating  a half billion views from Gymkhana THREE to Gymkhana TEN, to creating the Emmy nominated series The Gymkhana Files for Amazon Prime - along with building a fleet of Fords including the iconic AWD Mustang Hoonicorn and F-150 Hoonitruck - it’s been a great partnership. It’s simply been a dream come true to work with the company that built the truck that my Dad drove when I was a teenager. I’m super appreciative to Ford for the support over the years, but I am also looking forward to what an unrestricted 2021 holds, and the ability to spread my wings a bit and play with a lot other toys.2020 was a big year for Block and his Ford vehicles. He took the overall win at Rally Barbados in a WRC2 Ford Fiesta, won his class (and 3rd overall) at Rally Legend in San Marino in his Ford Escort Cossie V2, and also won the first ever Projekt E race of the FIA World RallyCross Championship in Holjes, Sweden, in a Ford Fiesta. Along with winning races, Block and Hoonigan launched the all-new viral video series,- Hoonicorn Vs The World. Spanning 11 episodes, the series features Ken racing his 1965 Ford Mustang RTR Hoonicorn against a variety of wild vehicles including a McLaren Senna and the World’s Fastest Donk. The series has been viewed over 34 million times since its launch in late November. What does the next chapter have in store? Ken Block and Hoonigan Racing Division will be announcing new partnerships very soon. In the meantime, enjoy this video of Ken’s favorite Ford – the 1,400 horsepower AWD Mustang Hoonicorn V2 – get taken on its “last ride”."

Today I am going to be painting and customizing a pair of my white vans. Shoes are such a fun item to paint, and I have so many ideas for ways to decorate these. I hope I give you some inspiration for a fun painting project!

This is always such a cool, creative and easy activity to do if you're bored or need to get over artist's block.

For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/2NGeIviProtesters supporting President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, causing Congress to suspend proceedings to confirm the election of Joe Biden as president.Protesters freely roamed through the Capitol complex, including the Senate chamber, where one man stood on the president of the Senate’s chair and shouted, “Trump won that election!”Several law enforcement officials said at least one person in the Capitol building had been shot, and that at least one improvised explosive device was been found on the Capitol grounds.Vice President Mike Pence, who had been presiding over the count of Electoral College votes, was rushed out of the Senate as the Capitol complex went into lockdown when Trump supporters began pouring into the building.Pence and Sen. Charles Grassley, the president pro-tempore, were taken to a secure location.A spokesperson for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she was “safe,” but would not elaborate on her whereabouts.Members of Congress were ordered to take shelter in the complex.At the same time, shocking images of a protester dangling from the balcony of the Senate chamber, a woman drenched in blood on a stretcher, Capitol police pointing guns on the floor of the House of Representatives, and other chaotic scenes played on television screens and Twitter feeds around the nation.“This is a coup attempt,” tweeted Rep. Adam Kinzinger, an Illinois Republican.Republican Sen.

Peterson to talk about Matthew’s new book, his upbringing, his relationships with his mother and father, his journey to being at peace with his fame, what it’s like to play malevolent or dark characters in movies or on television, and a surprising satirical review of Greenlights. Find Matthew McConaughey on Twitter @McConaughey and on Instagram @officiallymcconaughey and basically anywhere. Check out his new book Greenlights, which has sold more than 1 million copies, available at https://www.amazon.com/Greenlights-Matthew-McConaughey/dp/0593139135Dr. Jordan B. Peterson's new book, Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life, is available for preorder now: https://amzn.to/3l16Hzk-Show Notes:[1:00] Jordan Peterson kicks off the conversation by asking why and how Matthew McConaughey wrote his book Greenlights.[4:00] Matthew realized he needed to write the book himself without a ghostwriter as initially planned and dig back into his journals as a form of necessary reflection on the past.[6:00] Matthew’s old journals revealed their common thread through all the stories, poems, and bumper stickers. That common thread was the creation of good things in life through mindset or action “Greenlights.”[12:00] Jordan talks about his initial response after reading Matthew’s book and how his expectations were changed.[14:00] Matthew talks about his solo trips when starting to create the structure of his book. Jordan comments that this was a book written by a celebrity that did not really focus on the traditional parts of being a celebrity (very family-focused and foundational). Matthew states, “When we were editing the book, I found that the more personal the stories became, the more relatable they seemed to become, to the human condition, and that was my hope.”[18:00] Jordan and Matthew revisit the African trip, chasing dreams and having the same exact dream multiple times over the span of many years.[24:00] What was the personal impact on Matthew during his trip to Africa where he got to strip away the identity we all know him for and exist as something else? Jordan comments that very often, people confuse their reputation with who they really are, and they start to act as a representation of their reputation instead of themselves; it’s an easy trap to fall into.[22:00] Matthew discusses dealing with the pitfalls of fame. Matthew covers his changing relationship with his mother due to success.[25:00] Jordan B. Peterson asks Matthew McConaughey about some of his acting work in True Detective and playing dark characters. “How do you play a dark role very well without letting the darkness invade you?”[32:00] Matthew talks about the positive aspects of the sometimes tense relationship with his father and having a childhood that balanced love and hardship directed from the same people.[37:00] Jordan and Matthew continue talking about going deeper into the psychology of a dark character like Rustin Cole on True Detective[45:30] Matthew expanded on the short-term effects of initial fame.[51:30] Matthew and Jordan discuss the long-term effects of fame. [55:00] Jordan points out, “If flawed people were incapable of creativity, we would have no creativity.”[1:03:00] How Matthew and Jordan first became friends.[1:07:30] Matthew shares a comical review of his own book written as if Jordan was the one reviewing it.--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---Donations: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donateMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson--- BOOKS ---Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/beyond-order-12-more-rules-for-life/12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/--- LINKS ---Website: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/Blog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/Podcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/Reading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/Twitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpetersonInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson--- PRODUCTS ---Personality Course:  https://jordanbpeterson.com/personalitySelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/Understand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/Merchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson"

You can choose your cut of beef, and at this restaurant you get a hot iron griddle over charcoal to cook the beef yourself. Additionally they serve other Ko Khun Pon Yang Kham Beef (โคขุนโพนยางคํา) dishes - Isaan food - like nam tok and laap, made with this special beef.The owner of the restaurant, you can tell is very passionate about the beef he serves, and he ensures the quality by hand picking it out himself each day from the fresh beef.It was one of my first times to eat real Ko Khun Pon Yang Kham Beef (โคขุนโพนยางคํา) and I was impressed by the taste and flavor of this Thai grass fed beef. It’s not as soft or butter as Kobe beef or types of Wagyu, but it has a bit of texture and is very flavorful. I also thoroughly enjoyed the experience eating at Mong Yod Neua Yang Restaurant (ร้านโม้งยอดเนื้อย่าง) - it’s laid back, relaxing, and you can choose the places of beef you like. The sauces were also delicious.Also, when comparing the beef quality to the price, the value is incredible - might be some of the best quality beef for the price that I’ve had.Total price - 950 THB ($31.49) for everythingThank you for watching, and when you’re in Sakhon Nakhon, Thailand, don’t miss eating a local style Thai steakhouse bbq!🎵MUSIC: https://goo.gl/HwVjdo——————————————————🍌100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: http://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z👕Get t-shirts and caps:https://migrationology.com/store/——————————————————📱FOLLOW:Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology"

More than 6,000 National Guard troops will be in Washington DC, where a state of emergency has been declared until the day after Joe Biden's inauguration later this month. Meanwhile, authorities have announced new arrests and charges, and the FBI has appealed to the public to help bring more rioters to justice. And Twitter has become the latest social media giant to lock Trump out - permanently banning the president from the platform, citing the risk of further incitement of violence.The violent scenes of a few days ago have made way for this: a state of emergency, an unscalable fence, and more than six thousand National Guard troops. Stricter security measures are due to remain in place until after Joe Biden's inauguration this month.DC Residents, meanwhile, are still coming to terms with Wednesday's riot. Dozens of those who stormed the Capitol have now been arrested, with more arrests expected in the coming days. The FBI has appealed to the public to help bring more rioters to justice.House Democrats are pressing ahead with an article of impeachment on Monday, a move which would make Donald Trump the first ever President to be impeached twice. It could also mean that Trump would be unable to run for public office in future. It's a move that has received support from some Republicans, but critics say their turn against Trump has come too late.  As for President Trump, he's now been banned from Twitter as well as other social media platforms, who're quoting concerns over inciting further violence. Tech giants and members of Trump's own party may now also be turning against him, but across the country, there's still no shortage of people who support the outgoing president.Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1For more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/Follow DW on social media:►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnewsFür Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/channel/deutschewelle#DonaldTrump #GOP #UsCapitolRiots"

Joe Biden called it one of the “darkest days in US history”.  He  said it was the culmination of four years of attacks by Mr Trump on democracy, justice and the media. Leading Republicans are distancing themselves from Mr Trump, who has not condemned the rioters.   There are growing calls for him to be stripped of the Presidency —  just days before the official handover to Joe Biden.

Pro-Trump protesters stormed the Capitol building in Washington,  DC after a march decrying the vote in the Electoral College and oppose Congress' certification of the Republican president's Nov. 3 election loss. Protesters violently stormed the House Chamber to prevent President-Elect Joe Biden’s certification, leaving at least one woman dead and an unknown number injured at this time. The Metropolitan Police Department of Washington, D.C., said the woman, who was shot inside the Capitol during the protest, died at a nearby hospital. No other details were provided.The protests interrupted Congress as Republican lawmakers mounted their first official challenge to the certification of Biden’s presidential election win, objecting to state results from Arizona as they took up Trump’s relentless effort to overturn the election results in an extraordinary joint session of Congress.Democrats and Republicans condemned the mob as chaos descended onto the House Chamber floor and protesters supporting the president breached the Capitol building’s doors.For more info, please go to https://globalnews.ca/news/7558598/us-election-congress-biden-win-trump/Subscribe to Global News Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/20fcXDcLike Global News on Facebook HERE: http://bit.ly/255GMJQFollow Global News on Twitter HERE: http://bit.ly/1Toz8mtFollow Global News on Instagram HERE: https://bit.ly/2QZaZIB#uspoli #SaveAmerica #StopTheSteal #Trump #GlobalNews"

Shepard Smith reports. For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/2NGeIvi President Donald Trump on Thursday acknowledged for the first time that President-elect Joe Biden’s administration will take charge in less than two weeks.Without mentioning Biden by name, Trump said in a nearly three-minute video that “a new administration will be inaugurated on January 20th.”Trump, who had repeatedly vowed never to concede to Biden, backed dozens of failed lawsuits and flooded his Twitter account with baseless claims of voter fraud.His refusal to accept the election results culminated in a deadly riot on Wednesday, when swarms of his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol and derailed congressional proceedings to tally electors’ votes and confirm Biden’s win in the Nov. 3 election.“Now tempers must be cooled, and calm restored. We must get on with the business of America,” Trump said in his first address to the nation following the riot that left five people dead, including a Capitol police officer.“My focus now turns to ensuring a smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power,” the president added.Biden’s victory was projected by all major news outlets in mid-November and confirmed by Electoral College votes in mid-December. The Republican president has falsely insisted he won in a “landslide,” asserting his reelection was stolen through massive electoral fraud.The president, who was blocked from Twitter for 12 hours on Wednesday, briefly spoke about the pandemonium at the U.S. Capitol.“To those who engaged in the acts of violence and destruction, you do not represent our country. And to those who broke the law, you will pay,” Trump said in the video. In a video on Wednesday, as the mob swarmed the building, Trump said “we love you, you’re very special.”The rioters descended on Capitol directly after Trump told them at a rally outside the White House to march on the home of Congress to protest the election results.» Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision» Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC» Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassicTurn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.

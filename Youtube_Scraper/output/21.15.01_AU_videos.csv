The Impostor (who looks identical to the other players) kills off the crew members one-by-one.  After each death, the crew has an opportunity to vote one member off the ship, launching them into space to perish in hopes of getting rid of the Impostor.  Impostors have the unique ability to travel though a vent system on the spaceship, but must do so without being seen by other players - this puts them at immediate risk of being identified as the Imposter.Song: Baby I'm Yours by Breakbot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Orq1nMKZ7OYLearn this software for free through my Autodesk Maya Beginner Essentials training course playlist here on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHTiqada2E2CTu1ptM5LdN-yMUk97ZguW#Shorts #YouTubeShorts"

As of January 2021, that exclusivity comes to an end, with Block becoming a free agent. And that means his options behind the wheel are now wide open. ‚ÄúWorking  with Ford over the past decade has been awesome.‚Äù says Ken Block. ‚ÄúFrom racing all over the world, to accumulating  a half billion views from Gymkhana THREE to Gymkhana TEN, to creating the Emmy nominated series The Gymkhana Files for Amazon Prime - along with building a fleet of Fords including the iconic AWD Mustang Hoonicorn and F-150 Hoonitruck - it‚Äôs been a great partnership. It‚Äôs simply been a dream come true to work with the company that built the truck that my Dad drove when I was a teenager. I‚Äôm super appreciative to Ford for the support over the years, but I am also looking forward to what an unrestricted 2021 holds, and the ability to spread my wings a bit and play with a lot other toys.2020 was a big year for Block and his Ford vehicles. He took the overall win at Rally Barbados in a WRC2 Ford Fiesta, won his class (and 3rd overall) at Rally Legend in San Marino in his Ford Escort Cossie V2, and also won the first ever Projekt E race of the FIA World RallyCross Championship in Holjes, Sweden, in a Ford Fiesta. Along with winning races, Block and Hoonigan launched the all-new viral video series,- Hoonicorn Vs The World. Spanning 11 episodes, the series features Ken racing his 1965 Ford Mustang RTR Hoonicorn against a variety of wild vehicles including a McLaren Senna and the World‚Äôs Fastest Donk. The series has been viewed over 34 million times since its launch in late November. What does the next chapter have in store? Ken Block and Hoonigan Racing Division will be announcing new partnerships very soon. In the meantime, enjoy this video of Ken‚Äôs favorite Ford ‚Äì the 1,400 horsepower AWD Mustang Hoonicorn V2 ‚Äì get taken on its ‚Äúlast ride‚Äù."

Today I am going to be painting and customizing a pair of my white vans. Shoes are such a fun item to paint, and I have so many ideas for ways to decorate these. I hope I give you some inspiration for a fun painting project! I love making custom shoes because you can really put your own style on them and make them personal to you (even if you never actually wear them lol). This is always such a cool, creative and easy activity to do if you're bored or need to get over artist's block.

I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess.

Not S4 episode 5 was called declaration of war, and it begins with a brief flashback to Paradis island, during the time in which Reiner, Annie and Bertholt were infiltrating the walls.After the opening we see Willy Tybur preparing for his stage production, where he will be declaring war on Paradis island infront of journalists and diplomats from around the world. Unlike his usual confident self, Willy is visibly shaken in this moment. In episode 4 of the final season, commander Magath informed Willy that there was an infestation of rats in Marley, by which he meant that there are spies from Paradis island currently in the country. Moving on, Reiner comes face to face with Eren in this dimly lit cellar, and he can barely believe what he‚Äôs seeing. Eren orders Reiner to sit down and you can see that Falco is confused by their reactions. As I explained in my last review, Falco believes the two men are old friends, so Reiner‚Äôs blank expression is not exactly what he was expecting. Eren explains that the cellar they‚Äôre in is underneath a regular apartment building behind the stage. Obviously Reiner is aware of the threat, so he complies with Eren‚Äôs request to sit down, followed by an awkward silence in which Falco offers to leave. We then go back to Eren, Falco and Reiner, as the warrior finally musters up the courage, to ask Eren what he came here to do. Eren replies in epic fashion by telling Reiner he came to do the same thing that Reiner did himself, which is referring back to the attack on the walls all those years ago. Meanwhile the performance of Willy Tybur begins and along with the help of his cast and crew, he tells the story of how the eldian empire took over the world with the titans, after their ancestor Ymir gained the power all those years ago. While the performance continues, the soldier who approached the warriors tells Zeke to go to the front gate and leads Porco and Pieck to a different location. The solider leads the two warriors into a secluded property, before cutting the rope on a trap door and allowing the two to fall down a shaft.Back in the cellar, Falco begins to think about why Reiner looks so frightened and questions who exactly Mr Kruger really is. Because Eren claimed he was Reiner‚Äôs old friend, Falco realises that if they knew each other for so long, then in theory Eren could be someone from Paradis island. On stage, Willy Tybur‚Äôs performance then takes an interesting turn, as he begins to reveal the truth about the great titan war, which the Tybur family had kept a secret for over 100 years. It was revealed in the last episode, that the Tybur‚Äôs had secretly been in control of Marley since the great titan war, which is one of the things they gained by working with the king, in addition to their assured safety. Together with the Tybur‚Äôs, Fritz wanted to present a Marleyan as being responsible for ending the Eldian empire and Helos fulfilled that role. Fritz made a BINDING vow to renounce all war, which is why his successors such as Uri Reiss and Freida Reiss were unable to use the full power of the founding titan. They were always overtaken by Karl Frtiz‚Äôs ideology, and so even when titans were attacking their people, the vow renouncing war prevented them from taking real action. The attack titan manifests itself, completely destroying the cellar that Reiner and Falco were in, as well as the building full of civilians. He emerges infront of the diplomat and journalists from around the world, before crushing the stage and Willy Tybur with his bear hands. This moment was so iconic and I think it was done incredibly well, but let me know what you guys think down below."

I really liked the unique look of it with the hook instead of a hole to hang it on the wall. As christmas holidays were just around to happen, I knew I had to pick a project that I have all the material ready in my shop, because everybody was in vacation. So i choose to restore this cleaver.The disassembling was done very quickly, so was the sandblasting.The original handle was held in place with the peened tang. I didn't really like the shape of the handle and I also didn't wanted to peen the handle again. Si I decided to make a more ergonomic nice looking handle. That's why I shortened the tang around 45mm and drilled three 5mm holes in it. That went very well as the tang wasn't hardened. Next I wanted to make it mirror polished. I startet with the belt sander to grind away all the pitting from the rust. Then it was time for hand sanding. I started with 120 grit, after all the scratches were gone from the belt sander I moved on with 240. Then 400, 1000 and 1200 at the end. I then had a fine enough surface to be able to mirror polish it on the cotton buffing wheel. It took quite some time to do that, but the end result came out absolutely amazing.Moving on to the handle. I decided to make a three part sandwich. I started by making a spacer out of smoked oak. Cut out the shape of the tang and then glue it on to a piece of pear tree wood. Then I was able to file the spacer to the same tapered thickness of the tang. After gluing the other side of the handle on and drilling the holes for the rivets through I could start to rough shape the handle with a rasp.I decided to make three screwable brass rivets. I applied some Loctite on the threads and tighten them together. After that I filed the slotted heads away, flush to the handle. Then it was time to give the handle a final sanding with 120, 240, 400 and 1000 grit and apply linseed oil for the final touch. And after sharpening this job was done completely.I really liked to work on this cleaver. Mirror poilishing was a lot of work and also the work on the handle was quite challenging, but I really liked the end result and I think it speaks for itself.I hope you like my work and the video.Huge thank you to all of my Patreon supporters and specially to:Tonya M BroermanZack ThompsonAdel AlSaffarafreeflyingsoulYale BakerGregoryAlex McGeorgeAlistair MoorAmar.kAnthony EufemioBendurionCourtney MaleportDavid BarkerGreg MarstonJosh LedfordJoshua BentleyLambda GPU WorkstationsLuke SchmickLuke StoneMatt BoothmanMellissa MarcusMonte GibbsMuzaffer AksoyNick HoustonPaul MampillyPong LenispotokslowSchultes ThomasThomas & Jenni WendelTodd MedburyTyler CarruthVickie BlighVince ValentiXavier CarbelYuri ZapuchlakAaron QuanteAcechadoraAjnaAlex BretonAllen FrankAmanda Taylor, EsqAndreas MimraAndrew PhillipsAnthony AdamsArni Bjorgvinssonaudi4444playerBlake TBrandon FitzwaterBrian NewtonCarl SavageCarloChad BryantChris SimondetGrok SenftenHaley McFaddenHarper KimHunter R.isiovielJason KoiJason TarlovJeremy ColeJonas Richartzjustin f.Kelly ImgrundKurt GazowMarc CerisierMartin R√∏nnow KlarlundMellissa McConnellMichael BierMickey EisenhornMike DonaldsonNick CannonPasacal SchmikalPhilippRegis VincentScott MarshallSejo GavischSergei ShvartsmanStefan HalterSubramaniam VenkitaramanSuirosSvenja KucklaTrevor KamTucker IfftWarren G Strand JrWilliam WallaceÏõÖÎ°ù Ïú§My camera:Panasonic HC-VX11If you have any questions about the process, machines i'm using or other stuff, just ask me in the comments.

Charles Grassley, the president pro-tempore, were taken to a secure location.A spokesperson for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she was ‚Äúsafe,‚Äù but would not elaborate on her whereabouts.Members of Congress were ordered to take shelter in the complex.At the same time, shocking images of a protester dangling from the balcony of the Senate chamber, a woman drenched in blood on a stretcher, Capitol police pointing guns on the floor of the House of Representatives, and other chaotic scenes played on television screens and Twitter feeds around the nation.‚ÄúThis is a coup attempt,‚Äù tweeted Rep.

Today I am going to be painting and customizing a pair of my white vans. Shoes are such a fun item to paint, and I have so many ideas for ways to decorate these. I hope I give you some inspiration for a fun painting project!

This is always such a cool, creative and easy activity to do if you're bored or need to get over artist's block.

As of January 2021, that exclusivity comes to an end, with Block becoming a free agent. And that means his options behind the wheel are now wide open. ‚ÄúWorking  with Ford over the past decade has been awesome.‚Äù says Ken Block. ‚ÄúFrom racing all over the world, to accumulating  a half billion views from Gymkhana THREE to Gymkhana TEN, to creating the Emmy nominated series The Gymkhana Files for Amazon Prime - along with building a fleet of Fords including the iconic AWD Mustang Hoonicorn and F-150 Hoonitruck - it‚Äôs been a great partnership. It‚Äôs simply been a dream come true to work with the company that built the truck that my Dad drove when I was a teenager. I‚Äôm super appreciative to Ford for the support over the years, but I am also looking forward to what an unrestricted 2021 holds, and the ability to spread my wings a bit and play with a lot other toys.2020 was a big year for Block and his Ford vehicles. He took the overall win at Rally Barbados in a WRC2 Ford Fiesta, won his class (and 3rd overall) at Rally Legend in San Marino in his Ford Escort Cossie V2, and also won the first ever Projekt E race of the FIA World RallyCross Championship in Holjes, Sweden, in a Ford Fiesta. Along with winning races, Block and Hoonigan launched the all-new viral video series,- Hoonicorn Vs The World. Spanning 11 episodes, the series features Ken racing his 1965 Ford Mustang RTR Hoonicorn against a variety of wild vehicles including a McLaren Senna and the World‚Äôs Fastest Donk. The series has been viewed over 34 million times since its launch in late November. What does the next chapter have in store? Ken Block and Hoonigan Racing Division will be announcing new partnerships very soon. In the meantime, enjoy this video of Ken‚Äôs favorite Ford ‚Äì the 1,400 horsepower AWD Mustang Hoonicorn V2 ‚Äì get taken on its ‚Äúlast ride‚Äù."

I really liked the unique look of it with the hook instead of a hole to hang it on the wall. As christmas holidays were just around to happen, I knew I had to pick a project that I have all the material ready in my shop, because everybody was in vacation. So i choose to restore this cleaver.The disassembling was done very quickly, so was the sandblasting.The original handle was held in place with the peened tang. I didn't really like the shape of the handle and I also didn't wanted to peen the handle again. Si I decided to make a more ergonomic nice looking handle. That's why I shortened the tang around 45mm and drilled three 5mm holes in it. That went very well as the tang wasn't hardened. Next I wanted to make it mirror polished. I startet with the belt sander to grind away all the pitting from the rust. Then it was time for hand sanding. I started with 120 grit, after all the scratches were gone from the belt sander I moved on with 240. Then 400, 1000 and 1200 at the end. I then had a fine enough surface to be able to mirror polish it on the cotton buffing wheel. It took quite some time to do that, but the end result came out absolutely amazing.Moving on to the handle. I decided to make a three part sandwich. I started by making a spacer out of smoked oak. Cut out the shape of the tang and then glue it on to a piece of pear tree wood. Then I was able to file the spacer to the same tapered thickness of the tang. After gluing the other side of the handle on and drilling the holes for the rivets through I could start to rough shape the handle with a rasp.I decided to make three screwable brass rivets. I applied some Loctite on the threads and tighten them together. After that I filed the slotted heads away, flush to the handle. Then it was time to give the handle a final sanding with 120, 240, 400 and 1000 grit and apply linseed oil for the final touch. And after sharpening this job was done completely.I really liked to work on this cleaver. Mirror poilishing was a lot of work and also the work on the handle was quite challenging, but I really liked the end result and I think it speaks for itself.I hope you like my work and the video.Huge thank you to all of my Patreon supporters and specially to:Tonya M BroermanZack ThompsonAdel AlSaffarafreeflyingsoulYale BakerGregoryAlex McGeorgeAlistair MoorAmar.kAnthony EufemioBendurionCourtney MaleportDavid BarkerGreg MarstonJosh LedfordJoshua BentleyLambda GPU WorkstationsLuke SchmickLuke StoneMatt BoothmanMellissa MarcusMonte GibbsMuzaffer AksoyNick HoustonPaul MampillyPong LenispotokslowSchultes ThomasThomas & Jenni WendelTodd MedburyTyler CarruthVickie BlighVince ValentiXavier CarbelYuri ZapuchlakAaron QuanteAcechadoraAjnaAlex BretonAllen FrankAmanda Taylor, EsqAndreas MimraAndrew PhillipsAnthony AdamsArni Bjorgvinssonaudi4444playerBlake TBrandon FitzwaterBrian NewtonCarl SavageCarloChad BryantChris SimondetGrok SenftenHaley McFaddenHarper KimHunter R.isiovielJason KoiJason TarlovJeremy ColeJonas Richartzjustin f.Kelly ImgrundKurt GazowMarc CerisierMartin R√∏nnow KlarlundMellissa McConnellMichael BierMickey EisenhornMike DonaldsonNick CannonPasacal SchmikalPhilippRegis VincentScott MarshallSejo GavischSergei ShvartsmanStefan HalterSubramaniam VenkitaramanSuirosSvenja KucklaTrevor KamTucker IfftWarren G Strand JrWilliam WallaceÏõÖÎ°ù Ïú§My camera:Panasonic HC-VX11If you have any questions about the process, machines i'm using or other stuff, just ask me in the comments.

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit ‚Äî stripped-down sets, an intimate setting ‚Äî just a different space.Bobby Carter | January 8, 2021I don't recall any other artist at the Tiny Desk harmonizing their own introduction, but Philadelphia's own Jazmine Sullivan didn't waste a second, greeting us all by flexing those once-in-a-generation chops from the jump. The singer-songwriter, draped in a trench coat while her band sports all black, are nestled in the corner of a dimly lit space resembling a cabaret.We don't see or hear much from Jazmine Sullivan until she has something to get off her chest. She drops a body of work every five years or so, shakes up the world of R&B with each offering, then quietly goes back to minding her own business. Her latest project, Heaux Tales, is a bold and timely conversation piece addressing truths regarding relationships, sex, social norms, self-worth and a myriad of other topics that women graple with. Each song is masterfully connected to another through unique yet familiar testimonies by women from all walks of life.She starts her Tiny Desk (home) concert with three extended and reworked selections from Heaux Tales, squeezes in thee fan favorite from 2015's Reality Show, then invites Tiny Desk alum H.E.R. to the stage to close with Girl Like Me. Ms. Sullivan, her background vocalists and H.E.R. ate this performance up and left not a crumb on the floor.SET LISTBodies (Intro)The Other SideLost OneLet It BurnGirl Like Me (featuring H.E.R.)MUSICIANSJazmine Sullivan: vocalsH.E.R.: vocalsAlisa Joe: vocalsNatalie Curtis: vocalsAyana George: vocalsDave Watson: drumsSimon Martinez: guitarJermaine Blandford: bassEric Wortham: keysCREDITSVideo: Mansa Twin Johnson, Mignotae Kebede, Evan MorsellAudio: Chauncey BurneyCreative Director: Amaya SeguraSet Design: Matthew EnglebertExecutive Producer: Omari WilliamsTINY DESK TEAMProducer: Bobby CarterVideo Producer: Maia SternAudio Mastering: Josh RogosinTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara Frame, Morgan Noelle SmithExecutive Producer: Lauren OnkeySenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann"

Charles Grassley, the president pro-tempore, were taken to a secure location.A spokesperson for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she was ‚Äúsafe,‚Äù but would not elaborate on her whereabouts.Members of Congress were ordered to take shelter in the complex.At the same time, shocking images of a protester dangling from the balcony of the Senate chamber, a woman drenched in blood on a stretcher, Capitol police pointing guns on the floor of the House of Representatives, and other chaotic scenes played on television screens and Twitter feeds around the nation.‚ÄúThis is a coup attempt,‚Äù tweeted Rep. Adam Kinzinger, an Illinois Republican.Republican Sen.

President-elect Biden called on Mr Trump to tell his people to go home and eventually that was the message delivered from the White House.Washington‚Äôs Mayor ordered a curfew as members of the US National Guard were deployed to protect the city.

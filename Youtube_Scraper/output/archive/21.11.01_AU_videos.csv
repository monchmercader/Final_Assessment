Today I am going to be painting and customizing a pair of my white vans. Shoes are such a fun item to paint, and I have so many ideas for ways to decorate these. I hope I give you some inspiration for a fun painting project!

This is always such a cool, creative and easy activity to do if you're bored or need to get over artist's block.

I'm 25 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating, painting and general art videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up.

As of January 2021, that exclusivity comes to an end, with Block becoming a free agent. And that means his options behind the wheel are now wide open. ‚ÄúWorking  with Ford over the past decade has been awesome.‚Äù says Ken Block. ‚ÄúFrom racing all over the world, to accumulating  a half billion views from Gymkhana THREE to Gymkhana TEN, to creating the Emmy nominated series The Gymkhana Files for Amazon Prime - along with building a fleet of Fords including the iconic AWD Mustang Hoonicorn and F-150 Hoonitruck - it‚Äôs been a great partnership. It‚Äôs simply been a dream come true to work with the company that built the truck that my Dad drove when I was a teenager. I‚Äôm super appreciative to Ford for the support over the years, but I am also looking forward to what an unrestricted 2021 holds, and the ability to spread my wings a bit and play with a lot other toys.2020 was a big year for Block and his Ford vehicles. He took the overall win at Rally Barbados in a WRC2 Ford Fiesta, won his class (and 3rd overall) at Rally Legend in San Marino in his Ford Escort Cossie V2, and also won the first ever Projekt E race of the FIA World RallyCross Championship in Holjes, Sweden, in a Ford Fiesta. Along with winning races, Block and Hoonigan launched the all-new viral video series,- Hoonicorn Vs The World. Spanning 11 episodes, the series features Ken racing his 1965 Ford Mustang RTR Hoonicorn against a variety of wild vehicles including a McLaren Senna and the World‚Äôs Fastest Donk. The series has been viewed over 34 million times since its launch in late November. What does the next chapter have in store? Ken Block and Hoonigan Racing Division will be announcing new partnerships very soon. In the meantime, enjoy this video of Ken‚Äôs favorite Ford ‚Äì the 1,400 horsepower AWD Mustang Hoonicorn V2 ‚Äì get taken on its ‚Äúlast ride‚Äù."

Charles Grassley, the president pro-tempore, were taken to a secure location.A spokesperson for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she was ‚Äúsafe,‚Äù but would not elaborate on her whereabouts.Members of Congress were ordered to take shelter in the complex.At the same time, shocking images of a protester dangling from the balcony of the Senate chamber, a woman drenched in blood on a stretcher, Capitol police pointing guns on the floor of the House of Representatives, and other chaotic scenes played on television screens and Twitter feeds around the nation.‚ÄúThis is a coup attempt,‚Äù tweeted Rep.

I really liked the unique look of it with the hook instead of a hole to hang it on the wall. As christmas holidays were just around to happen, I knew I had to pick a project that I have all the material ready in my shop, because everybody was in vacation. So i choose to restore this cleaver.The disassembling was done very quickly, so was the sandblasting.The original handle was held in place with the peened tang. I didn't really like the shape of the handle and I also didn't wanted to peen the handle again. Si I decided to make a more ergonomic nice looking handle. That's why I shortened the tang around 45mm and drilled three 5mm holes in it. That went very well as the tang wasn't hardened. Next I wanted to make it mirror polished. I startet with the belt sander to grind away all the pitting from the rust. Then it was time for hand sanding. I started with 120 grit, after all the scratches were gone from the belt sander I moved on with 240. Then 400, 1000 and 1200 at the end. I then had a fine enough surface to be able to mirror polish it on the cotton buffing wheel. It took quite some time to do that, but the end result came out absolutely amazing.Moving on to the handle. I decided to make a three part sandwich. I started by making a spacer out of smoked oak. Cut out the shape of the tang and then glue it on to a piece of pear tree wood. Then I was able to file the spacer to the same tapered thickness of the tang. After gluing the other side of the handle on and drilling the holes for the rivets through I could start to rough shape the handle with a rasp.I decided to make three screwable brass rivets. I applied some Loctite on the threads and tighten them together. After that I filed the slotted heads away, flush to the handle. Then it was time to give the handle a final sanding with 120, 240, 400 and 1000 grit and apply linseed oil for the final touch. And after sharpening this job was done completely.I really liked to work on this cleaver. Mirror poilishing was a lot of work and also the work on the handle was quite challenging, but I really liked the end result and I think it speaks for itself.I hope you like my work and the video.Huge thank you to all of my Patreon supporters and specially to:Tonya M BroermanZack ThompsonAdel AlSaffarafreeflyingsoulYale BakerGregoryAlex McGeorgeAlistair MoorAmar.kAnthony EufemioBendurionCourtney MaleportDavid BarkerGreg MarstonJosh LedfordJoshua BentleyLambda GPU WorkstationsLuke SchmickLuke StoneMatt BoothmanMellissa MarcusMonte GibbsMuzaffer AksoyNick HoustonPaul MampillyPong LenispotokslowSchultes ThomasThomas & Jenni WendelTodd MedburyTyler CarruthVickie BlighVince ValentiXavier CarbelYuri ZapuchlakAaron QuanteAcechadoraAjnaAlex BretonAllen FrankAmanda Taylor, EsqAndreas MimraAndrew PhillipsAnthony AdamsArni Bjorgvinssonaudi4444playerBlake TBrandon FitzwaterBrian NewtonCarl SavageCarloChad BryantChris SimondetGrok SenftenHaley McFaddenHarper KimHunter R.isiovielJason KoiJason TarlovJeremy ColeJonas Richartzjustin f.Kelly ImgrundKurt GazowMarc CerisierMartin R√∏nnow KlarlundMellissa McConnellMichael BierMickey EisenhornMike DonaldsonNick CannonPasacal SchmikalPhilippRegis VincentScott MarshallSejo GavischSergei ShvartsmanStefan HalterSubramaniam VenkitaramanSuirosSvenja KucklaTrevor KamTucker IfftWarren G Strand JrWilliam WallaceÏõÖÎ°ù Ïú§My camera:Panasonic HC-VX11If you have any questions about the process, machines i'm using or other stuff, just ask me in the comments.

It has four-wheel drive, a turbocharged flat-six, carbon panels, trick suspension and a stripped out interior, but still retains the outrageous attention to detail of all Singer‚Äôs creations.

The Impostor (who looks identical to the other players) kills off the crew members one-by-one.  After each death, the crew has an opportunity to vote one member off the ship, launching them into space to perish in hopes of getting rid of the Impostor.  Impostors have the unique ability to travel though a vent system on the spaceship, but must do so without being seen by other players - this puts them at immediate risk of being identified as the Imposter.Animation by me, concept by @AmongUsTheCrew on TikTok: https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMJGoP3wP/The audio from this clip comes from a vine: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrTEl9nb-3QLearn this software for free through my Autodesk Maya Beginner Essentials training course playlist here on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHTiqada2E2CTu1ptM5LdN-yMUk97ZguW#Shorts #YouTubeShorts"

That sequel comes three years later in the form of Wonder Woman 1984, which in a historic first for a massive superhero blockbuster - came out on streaming at the same time as in theatres!Wonder Woman 1984 movie definitely raises some questions. Like why did Steve Trevor return through some random guy? Why are they using this man‚Äôs body for anything they like? Why is there a fully-fueled jet lying around at the Smithsonian and how does Steve Trevor know how to fly it? How does Diana know how to make it invisible? How did Wonder Woman get her lasso around Max Lord? How did literally everyone renounce their wishes? How did nobody wish the world to immediately end? What exactly is the message of this movie?!To answer all these questions and more, step inside the Pitch Meeting that led to Wonder Woman 1984!

Who did he call at the end?Well, after his fight with Johnny and Daniel, he proposed to them that the loser of the next tournament, leaves the valley, for good. With Johnny and Daniel now teaming up, this leaves Kreese outnumbered heavily. So he needs to bring in the reinforcements. The entire season we got flashbacks of Kreese in his younger years, where we learned he was actually quite a stand up guy. In the army, Kreese was sent on a mission with his Captain and some men. During the war, he made a friend, Terry Silver who also went on this side mission with him. They were eventually captured and imprisoned in a cell with bars. They soon realized that they were going to be put to a fight to the death between one another above a pit of thousands of poisonous snakes and cobras. When the Vietnamese officer came into the cell to decide who would fight who next, he pointed to Terry Silver and the Captain. Silver was terrified, he couldn‚Äôt move and he pleaded to no go, knowing he would die. John Kreese stood up and took the place of his friend, fighting the captain to the death, and sending him to his snakey doom as the United States airforce flew overhead and napalmed the area, saving the soldiers.As Kreese ran to the cell of cheering men, he opened the gate and let them free, when the last to thank him was Terry Silver, who seriously looked John in the eyes and told him he owed him for saving his ass, that no matter what, anything he would need he‚Äôd be there for him, his whole life, whatever he needs. So now Kreese is taking that favour and calling his old buddy Terry Silver.Now if you don‚Äôt know who Mr. Silver is, I have many videos on him as he‚Äôs my favourite character in Karate Kid. He‚Äôs as Snakey as he is rich. In Karate Kid 3 he trained Daniel while he manipulated him to become someone he wasn‚Äôt. He owned Dynatox industries, where he‚Äôd dump nuclear sludge anywhere he wanted, and he‚Äôd make billions. His goal in Karate Kid was to humiliate Daniel by hiring Mike Barnes, Karate‚Äôs Bad Boy, to beat him at the All Valley tournament, basically a public statement that cobra Kai is back on top and beat the current champ. Silver was then going to open 20 new dojos all across the valley. This of course never happened, as Daniel beat Mike in the tournament after confusing him to Kata, and throwing him off his game. Mike Barnes is by far the most powerful and sadistic fighter in the entire karate kid universe. He would beat Johnny and Chozen, at least back then, as he proved to be the most difficult opponent for Daniel. He was a powerhouse and he won tournaments all across America. If Kreese joins with silver, there‚Äôs no telling just what to expect. Silver is extremely smart and manipulative, and powerful.Silver could bring Mike Barnes back, if Mike is still in the Karate game, perhaps bringing his own lethal students in if he‚Äôs a teacher. This could make Cobra Kai unbeatable. If Cobra Kai wins the tournament, then Eagle Fang and Miyagi-Do must leave the valley, ceasing to exist in the Karate world, with only Cobra Kai being the biggest dojo, training kids to become jerks for years to come.Terry Silver makes Kreese look like a good guy, he‚Äôs very dangerous, and I can‚Äôt wait to see him return.Let me know what your favourite part of season 3 was, I hope you enjoyed it. Have an awesome rest of your day, and remember, pain does not exist in this dojo!Cobra Kai Season 3 is now on Netflix"

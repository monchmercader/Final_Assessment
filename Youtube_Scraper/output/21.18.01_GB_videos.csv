We've got Mat in 'his' Audi RS6, going up against Yianni's Lamborghini Urus! When it comes to performance stats, both of these are easily drag race ready. The Audi's packing a 4-litre twin-turbo with the ability to put down 600hp & 800Nm of torque! As you might expect though, it's pretty heavy, weighing in at 2,075kg. As for Yianni's Urus? Well under the bonnet you'll find the exact same 4-litre twin-turbo V8 as in the RS6, however it's been tuned to deliver 650hp & 850Nm! It does weigh a bit more though, coming in at 2,199kg. So how do you think this one will play out? We all know Yianni's the king of reaction times (sorry Mat üò¨) but will the extra weight work against him?! There's only one way to find out...

Constance's lovely channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_ClFJYwA3lDagY4igPKddg Labor ethics disclaimer from the brand which the corset was purchased: https://www.adidas-group.com/en/sustainability/people/factory-workers/Despite this disclaimer, however, I was unable to find satisfactory evidence to prove that the brand have established contractual requirements with their manufacturers to ensure that the factories commissioned to manufacture products are paying their employees at living wages. Furthermore, I was disappointed to find that this brand is one of the many guilty of cancelling partly- or fully-completed orders this year without paying manufacturers for labor performed. For this reason, I do not endorse this brand and I do consider this purchase to be in violation of my anti-fast fashion endeavors. Though I won‚Äôt be returning the item, as that doesn‚Äôt do anything productive, I will upcycle it into something I can use‚Äîand intend to give the purchase of this garment a net-positive outcome by donating the ad revenue from this video to the Clean Clothes Campaign (https://cleanclothes.org/about), an organisation which is dedicated to improving garment worker rights and conditions worldwide. https://goodonyou.eco/adidas-ethical/2019 report on brands and ethical labor policies/future plans: https://labourbehindthelabel.org/report-tailored-wages-uk-2019/https://www.ethicalconsumer.org/company-profile/adidas-agSOURCES & FOOTNOTES:Due to character limitations, the full page of footnotes can be found here: https://bernadettebanner.co.uk/sports-corsetsGartland, Elizabeth.

When the Girls Came Out to Play: The Birth of American Sportswear. Massachusetts, University of Massachusetts Press, August 2, 2006.*I actually disagree with this; I mean, yes, it *could* probably be worn over another corset, but the advertisement declares that this corselet 'supersedes the corset' and highlights its intention to be worn only on the upper part of the body, allowing for perfect freedom of movement in the lower. I think they've drawn this conclusion because of the strange little buttoned tabs coming out the bottom of it, but the advertisement shows the woman using these tabs to button the waist of her skirt in place. Since the Khiva corselet is very short in length, it wouldn't provide that secure anchor point at the waist that normal, bust-to-hip corsets do.

Up top we're gonna be dropping some big fan theories and then we'll continue with our more traditional breakdown but it's all gonna be time coded in the description below.Now the last time we saw Vision he was giving a piece of his mind to Thanos and Wanda was moping around after the Avengers saved the universe. Cheer up love it's a funeral.Now the series itself picks up with us having very little idea over what it is that's exactly going on and why the character are in this strange 1950s sitcom world.Now in death Vision actually turned grey and this was very similar to his silver costume in the comics that became a big part of the character. Though we know from the trailers that that won't remain I love the black and white aesthetic here that sort of ties into that Easter Egg and who knows he may turn back to being grey at some point.As for Wanda she has clearly created this pocket dimension and though we don't know exactly what's going on just yet there was a big clue in one of the tv spots that was recently released. Now I just wanna give a huge shoutouts to @kwistatz on twitter for sending me this through and the trailer ends like most do with a voice over announcing when it's coming out. However instead of saying streaming friday it sounds like he says dreaming friday and when you turn on closed captions you can see that this is indeed the case.-This mistake seems deliberate and to me it's hinting that Wanda is actually dreaming this entire reality and due to her powers it may have manifested. This could mean that the character is actually asleep at the centre of it all and the reality is building up around her.The characters that we see could have been sucked into this and this is why they are unable to remember what's going on outside of their reality. The people that we see the pair interact with could be doctors or psychologists on the outside trying to help her with her grief and they've become trapped in the dimension unable to escape from it.Visions Tie also could be hinting at people being enclosed in something and from what we see it has a rectangle with two dots inside of it. These two dots could represent both Wanda and Vision who are trapped inside this box that the former has dreamt up.‚ñ∫ Artist AttributionLofi Geek @Spotify: https://spoti.fi/3g16PgrLofi Geek Official Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyD59CI7beJDU493glZpxgAArtwork @mb0sco"

A week after hundreds of the President‚Äôs supporters violently invaded the US Capitol - forcing Congressmen and women to flee - Representatives voted to impeach Mr Trump for inciting insurrection and falsely claiming the presidential election victory of Joe Biden was fraudulent.  Several Republicans abandoned the president and backed the articles of impeachment.A trial will now take place in the Senate - the upper house of Congress.   If US senators also support impeachment, Donald Trump will be banned from every standing again for any public office in the United States.
